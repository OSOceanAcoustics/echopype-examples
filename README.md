# echopype-examples

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples/main)

## Purpose

This repository illustrates the functionalities of [echopype](https://echopype.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an open source python library that enables interoperability and scalability in ocean sonar data analysis. The materials can be found within the `notebooks` folder in `.ipynb` files, which are [Jupyter notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).

Data courtesy of [Ocean Observatories Initiative](https://oceanobservatories.org/) (OOI).

To explore: Click on the binder badge above to launch a sandbox copy. Typical start time will be about 3 minutes. Once binder finishes try running the first notebook, `EK60_demo_OOI.ipynb`. When you are done just close the browser tab and the sandbox will evaporate.
