## Running the notebooks

The notebooks in this site can be run locally with a [conda](https://docs.conda.io) environment created following the [instructions in the repository README.md](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples#run-the-notebooks-locally-on-your-machine).

If you want to try these notebooks on Binder, follow instructions [here](https://github.com/OSOceanAcoustics/echopype-examples#run-the-notebooks-on-the-cloud-via-binder). However, due to the limited resources on Binder, the execution of some notebooks may fail as noted above.

Please see the last cell in each notebook to see the version of Echopype and important dependencies the notebook was last run with.
